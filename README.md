I decided to challenge myself and use bootstrap along with CSS.

I found that working with bootstrap, I preferred vanilla CSS. Bootstrap has great out of the box tricks, and is a valuable tool. But I found it much faster to align items using CSS flexbox.

This is a technical document to inform the user about Javascript.

Technologies used are

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
